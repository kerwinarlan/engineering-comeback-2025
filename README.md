# My Engineering Comeback (2025)

*November 18, 2025 — 9:31 PM*  
Created this repo to document my return to Civil Engineering and entry to Data Engineering after a long hiatus.  
This space will track my progress, projects, and consistent skill building.

### ✅ Current Focus
- Preparing for the DE101: Data Engineer Associate Exam  
- Strengthening SQL fundamentals (Postgres/Snowflake)  
- Daily Python practice (Asabeneh’s 30 Days of Python)  
- Rebuilding CE fundamentals and thesis work  

### 🔄 Upcoming Additions (This Week)
- DataCamp certificates + streak logs  
- SQL practice scripts  
- Python progress  
- Notes and references for updated thesis topic

### 🧭 Why I Created This Repo
- To rebuild my engineering identity through disciplined, daily action  
- To track my learning journey publicly for accountability  
- To build my coding + CE portfolio slowly but consistently
