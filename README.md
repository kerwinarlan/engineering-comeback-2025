# My Engineering Comeback - 2025

## November 18, 2025 - 9:31 PM 
Created this repo to document my return to Civil Engineering and entry to Data Engineering after a long hiatus.
This space will track my progress, projects, and consistent skill building.

## Current Focus
  Preparing for the DE101: Data Engineer Associate Exam
  Strengthening SQL fundamentals (PostgreSQL)
  Rebuilding CE fundamentals and thesis work

## Upcoming Additions
  DataCamp certificates + streak logs
  SQL practice scripts
  Python progress
  Notes and references for updated thesis topic

## Why I Created This Repo
  To rebuild my engineering identity through disciplined, daily action
  To track my learning journey publicly for accountability
  To build my coding + CE portfolio slowly but consistently
